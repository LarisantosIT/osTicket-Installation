Once you have logged into your VM you need have to enable IIS, which is an abrevation for Internet Information Services. To do so go into control panel and select uninstall a program. Under the navigation tree located to the left select "Turn windows features on or off". Once the list populates you will then enable Internet Information Services and selecting okay.

3 files will fail to install but you only need to install 2 out of the 3 which would be the C++ and PHP Manager. These files can found in the google drive link. Below I have attatched an image with the 2 files that you need to download circled.
